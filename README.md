# GraphFX
A simple graphing calculator by Bruce Nguyen


Download
==========
GraphFX requires Java 8+. All jar files must be in the same directory.

1. Extract GraphFX.zip to any folder
2. Run loographer.jar


How to Use
==========
GraphFX should be very intuitive to use. In the textbox, input any function 
using standard mathematical notation. Any bad input will be marked with a
caution symbol. Hovering over it will give a rough idea of what's wrong.

Next to the textbox is a colour picker, which will change the colour of the
drawn function.
